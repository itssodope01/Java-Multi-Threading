# Java-Multi-Threading
Multi-Threading &amp; Syncronized Data: 

1--> Sum of array using multithreading capabilities.

2--> Two thread objects that share the same array with N elements (for example N = 5). One
thread, instantiation of the GetNumbers reads the numers from the keyboard, and fills an
array with them. The second thread, instantiation of the GetSum calculates the sum of the
array (when the array is filled).
